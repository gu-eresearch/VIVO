<h3>Search Tips</h3>        
<ul>
    <li>Use short, single terms unless your searches are returning too many results</li>
    <li>When you enter more than one term, the search will look for records containing <strong>all</strong> of them unless you add the word "OR" between your terms.</li>
    <li>"NOT" can help limit searches -- e.g., <i>climate NOT change</i></li>
    <li>Except for boolean operators, searches are <strong>not</strong> case-sensitive, so "Geneva" and "geneva" are equivalent</li>
    <li>Enclose a phrase in quotes (") to search for the whole phrase, not individual words (e.g., "protein folding") -- <i>both leading and ending quotes are required</i></li>
    <li>Phrase searches may be combined with boolean operators: <i>"climate change" OR "global warming"</i></li>
    <li>The search uses <strong>stemming</strong> by default so that close word variations will also be found (e.g., "sequence" also matches "sequences" and "sequencing").
        Use the wildcard <strong>*</strong> character to match wider variation (e.g., <strong>nano*</strong> to match both
        <i>nanotechnology</i> and <i>nanofabrication</i>), but note that searching uses <i>stemmed</i>, or shortened, versions of words,
        so "cogniti*" finds nothing while "cognit*" finds both <i>cognitive</i> and <i>cognition</i></li>
    <li>If you're not sure of the spelling, put a <strong>~</strong> at the end -- e.g., <i>cabage~</i> finds <i>cabbage</i>,
        <i>steven~</i> finds <i>Stephen</i> and <i>Stefan</i> (as well as a few unwanted extra words)</li>
    <li>To match a person or unit's primary entry, enter <i>name: Smith</i> or <i>name: Biology</i></li>
</ul>
